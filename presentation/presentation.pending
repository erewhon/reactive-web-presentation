- Todo apps seem to be the norm.  I'm going to do something simpler /
  different: Buttonz.  Have some D3 for fun.
- Schnippets / documental.
- Func(this)



From bacon FAQ:

     Doesn't this turn "callback" hell into "mapfiltercombine" hell?
     How I will integrate a new developer to my FRP code?

     What FRP does to callback hell is the same thing that FP does to
     for-loops. Some may argue that for-loops are easier to read than
     a map-filter-combo. It's the same thing with all new tools. Some
     managers fear that their employees will never learn Scala, so
     everything has to be written in Java. Would you still like to
     write code in Cobol?

# Bonus

## Visualization

<aside class="notes">
Toggl.  Too complicated.  Buttons as a service.   (Baas)

Toggle buttons.  Time D3.
</aside>

## Visualization - integration

<aside class="notes">

integrate with Google Maps for real time tracking?

</aside>

## Func(this)

<aside class="notes">

Functional voice app.  (Perhaps save the real deal for Clojure,
ClojureScript, core.logic?)

</aside>


## F&sharp;

<aside class="notes">

So, just for shiggles, let's do it in F#

</aside>

## F&sharp;?

<aside class="notes">

Yes, F#.  In the browser.

</aside>

## How

- WebSharper
- FunScript

<aside class="notes">

These are both projects that take F# and compile it to Javascript.
Yes... yes they do.

</aside>

 But how much of it is the magical FRP bits?  
Let's
try writing some functional code.

## Dynamic vs static graphs


## notes


questions I haven't answered yet:
- BaconJS - flavors?  Behaviors vs ?

what about good examples for reactive?  um... games?

every third word

(have that diagram on reactive?  which diagram?)
